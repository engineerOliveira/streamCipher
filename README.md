# streamCipher
@author Anthony Oliveira

This Program allows the user to encrypt their text files while using a stream cipher.A stream cipher is a symetirc key cipher. Stream ciphers encrypt plain text digits one at a time with a private key stream that only the user has acsess too. The user is given the option to select any *.txt file they want. The program writes the binary represetnation of the encrypted information to this selected file . If attempted to convert this encrypted binary to Ascii, it would convert to random string with no way to determine the original plain text without the key. After encryption the program creates a file on the users desktop with the private key stream. this keyboard should be copied to the clip board, and used when user wants to decrypt. The decrypt option presented by the GUI will ask the user to select the file they wish to decrypt, and prompt them to enter the keystream. Once user has pasted the correct keystream and selects "Decrypt" their selected file will return to its original plaintext.
